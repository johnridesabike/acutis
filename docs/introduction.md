Acutis is written in [OCaml], and familiarity with the OCaml toolchain is a
prerequisite for using it. It also comes with a JavaScript API to use in web or
Node.js projects.

[ocaml]: https://ocaml.org/

Beware: both the OCaml and JavaScript API are unstable and experimental.

[The OCaml API is documented here](../api/).

You can also use the [CLI].

[cli]: #acutis-command-line-interface-(cli)

## Why Acutis?

Acutis is an experiment with a new kind of template language.

I created Acutis because there were specific language features I wanted in my
templates that I couldn't find in existing projects. I was inspired by the
declarative, component-based design in React as well as the pattern-matching
abilities in OCaml.

## What state is it in?

Acutis is young software. I'm currently the only person who uses it. Also, I
haven't developed much editor tooling for it yet. Use it if you don't mind
getting your getting your hands dirty.

## Installation: OPAM

The OCaml package manager, OPAM, can install Acutis by using the URL to its git
repository.

```shell
opam pin https://github.com/johnridesabike/acutis.git
```

This command will install three packages:

<dl>
<dt class="font-monospace">
  acutis
<dd>
  The core Acutis library.

<dt class="font-monospace">
  acutis_json
<dd>
  A JSON-compatible implementation. This also includes the CLI.

<dt class="font-monospace">
  acutis_js
<dd>
  A JavaScript-compatible implementation for compiling with js_of_ocaml.
</dl>

## Installation: JavaScript

The JavaScript API is available through npm.

```shell
npm install acutis-lang
```

## Editor plugins

These offer basic syntax highlighting and indentation features.

- [Vim plugin](https://github.com/johnridesabike/vim-acutis)
- [VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jbpjackson.acutis-vscode)

## Examples

## Acutis command line interface (CLI)

If you install Acutis through OPAM, then the `acutis_json` package comes with a
command-line tool called `acutis`. This accepts JSON data and a list of template
filenames, and it prints the rendered output.

```shell
acutis index.acutis src/**/*.acutis < data.json > dist/index.html
```

Full options:

```txt
Parse and execute Acutis language templates.

Usage:
  acutis [options] [template] [...templates]

Options:
  --data     The path to a JSON data file. Default: stdin.
  --output   The path to write the output. Default: stdout.
  --version  Show the version number and exit.
  -help      Display this list of options
  --help     Display this list of options
```
