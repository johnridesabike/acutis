You can integrate Acutis with your existing build process through its [API].
There aren't any configuration files or starter projects yet.

To start quickly experimenting with it without a build system, you can use the
[CLI].

## Why Acutis?

Use Acutis if you want to experiment with a different kind of template language.

I created Acutis because there were specific language features I wanted in my
templates, and a few features I didn't want. I was inspired by the functional,
component-based design in React as well as the pattern-matching abilities in
ReScript (and OCaml, and all of the other languages in that family).

## What state is it in?

Acutis is young software. In the "make it work, make it right, make it fast"
order, it's just at the end of the "make it work" stage. I'm the only person who
uses it who I know of.

Also, I haven't developed any editor tooling for it yet.

## Installation

Acutis is available through npm. You can install it locally for a project:

```shell
npm install acutis-lang
```

Or globally:

```shell
npm install -g acutis-lang
```

If you're using it in a ReScript project, then add it to the dependencies in
your `bsconfig.json` file.

```json
{
  "bs-dependencies": ["acutis-lang"]
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Acutis requires ReScript compiler version 9.0 or higher.

## Editor plugin

### VS Code

You can enable syntax highlighting with [the VS Code extension.][vscode]
