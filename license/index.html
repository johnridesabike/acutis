Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be<br>protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and<br>Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not<br>limited to, the following:<br><br>  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,<br>     communicate, and translate a Work;<br> ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);<br>iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or<br>     likeness depicted in a Work;<br> iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,<br>     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;<br>  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data<br>     in a Work;<br> vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the<br>     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal<br>     protection of databases, and under any national implementation<br>     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such<br>     directive); and<br>vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the<br>     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national<br>     implementations thereof.<br><br>2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention<br>of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,<br>irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of<br>Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes<br>of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as<br>future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories<br>worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or<br>treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future<br>medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,<br>including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional<br>purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each<br>member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and<br>successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to<br>revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or<br>equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public<br>as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.<br><br>3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason<br>be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the<br>Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into<br>account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the<br>extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected<br>person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,<br>irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and<br>Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the<br>maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future<br>time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number<br>of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without<br>limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the<br>"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was<br>applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any<br>reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such<br>partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder<br>of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she<br>will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related<br>Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of<br>action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's<br>express Statement of Purpose.<br><br>4. Limitations and Disclaimers.<br><br> a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,<br>    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.<br> b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or<br>    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,<br>    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of<br>    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non<br>    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or<br>    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to<br>    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.<br> c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons<br>    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without<br>    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.<br>    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary<br>    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the<br>    Work.<br> d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a<br>    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to<br>    this CC0 or use of the Work.</code></pre>

Redistribution.

You are solely responsible for determining the<br>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br><br>   8. Limitation of Liability.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br><br>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br><br>      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br>      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"<br>      replaced with your own identifying information.
